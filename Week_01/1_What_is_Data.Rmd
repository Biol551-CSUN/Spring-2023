# Our semester: venturing into the wonderful world of reproducible and transparent data

--

This class is **NOT**:
- A statistics course (check out Biometry)
- A bioinformtics course (check out bioinformatics)

--

We **will**:

- Learn best practices for data entry
- Learn how to create clean and reproducible scripts in the program *R*
- Learn to share code and data on a public version-controlled repository
- Work collaboratively on a project
- Create high quality visuals using *R*
- Learn to love working with Data!

# Our semester: venturing into the wonderful world of reproducible and transparent data

### We will create beautiful graphics that enable us to better understand our data using #TidyTuesday (details to follow)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width = 1}
library(tweetrmd)
tweet_screenshot(tweet_url("nsilbiger", "1219857312807940096"),
  #maxwidth = 100,
  theme = "dark",
  scale = 0.5

I will go over each of these components in future lectures.   


All rubrics are on Canvas and details on syllabus.

# Communication
<img src = "https://seekvectorlogo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/slack-technologies-vector-logo.png", width=50%, align="center" />

I created a class slack channel that you all can use to easily ask your classmates for help, give advice, and share resources.

[Click Here to Join](https://join.slack.com/t/biol551csun/shared_invite/zt-kgyyp4k3-lvbGUeyNnvqC1YFgb5h1FA) or see in the syllabus.

What is slack? [See here](https://slack.com/intl/en-pf/)

Is it free? **YES**

# How to get class assignments and lectures?

This week, everything will be on Canvas.
Starting next week all assignments and lecture slides will be on Github (a free online repository).  

- We will have weekly lab assignments that can be started (even completed!) during lab time.

What is Github?

Stay tuned....

# Group work

This class is structured on the principle that you learn just as much from your peers (both teaching and listening) as you do from me.  Therefore, while all your assignments are to be turned in independently you will be assigned to a group to work with for the entire semester that ranges in skill level.  At the beginning, the more advanced students will learn to be better coders by helping to mentor the beginners, while the beginners will be brought up to speed more quickly by having advanced coders to ask questions.  

You will also have many "think-pair-share" opportunities during lectures. I encourage you to "pair" with different students each class because every one thinks differently. Learning from different thinkers will help you think more broadly about coding.

# Readings

All textbooks are free and online for this class.

- Links for the books are in the syllabus.  

--

- All required reading (listed each week) should be completed **before** class.  

--

- Use active reading. Most readings come with code. If you do it before class then it will be much easier to work through and understand the content in class

# Short quizzes

### 10 min quiz, every two weeks  

- Concepts from required readings, labs, and lectures
- Open notes, but no discussing with classmates (but the quiz is only 10 mins... so make sure to prepare)
- Lowest grade dropped

---
# Projects

### Group Project
- Present an R package that we did not discuss in class and present it to your peers

--

### Independent Final Project
- Visualization and explanation of a data set of your choosing (from your own work or found data)
- Bringing together multiple data sets are encouraged!
- In the coming weeks start thinking about what data you would like to use and what questions you would like to answer. You will propose your ideas with me for approval.

# What is data?

---

# Data comes in lots of forms

### There are several **Data Types** in R that you will need to know

--
.orange[character] : Can be a letter or a combination of letters enclosed by quotes is considered as a character data type by R. It can be alphabets or numbers  
- ex: "a", "my name is Dr. Silbiger"

--

.orange[numeric]: Numbers that have a decimal value or are a fraction in nature have a data type as a numeric (also called "double")  
- ex: 2.0, 14.573849 

--

.orange[integer]: Numbers that do not contain decimal values have a data type as an integer  
- ex: 1, 2, 3, 4

--

.orange[logical]: A variable that can have a value of True and False  
- ex: TRUE, FALSE

---

# Data types con't

.orange[complex]: An imaginary number.
- ex: 1+4i

--

.orange[factor]: They are a data type that is used to refer to a qualitative relationship like colors, good & bad, course or movie ratings, etc. They are useful in statistical modeling.
- ex: "Good", "Better", "Best"

--

### Knowing the names of all these data types and what they mean is important

---
# Data can also come in many *structures*

### Our first lab is an intro to R/R refresher. 

### But, first, a 10 minute break!

### Next class is all about making data sheets. Don't forget to do the reading assignment before class.
